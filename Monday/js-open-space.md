## Converting AMD to ES6

Write ES6 today, add a Babel build step. Don't forget the AMD plugin!

Switch to Webpack for bundling if you aren't ties to RequireJS plugins.

## Embracing New Frameworks

You still have to ship features, you can't do a complete overhaul. Convert piece by piece.

Don't need to chase a company-wide standard, very difficult.

3 D's - Define, Document, and Defend

Should be easy to pick up standards when switching teams. Linting helps!

Trouble arrives with lack of continued re-investment - don't give up half way!

Two hats, company standards and features due next week. Can't apply same problem solving tactics to both.

Incremental improvements is good, but it must reach an eventual consensus.

No defense for cleverness.

Celebrate explanations as much as problems solving.

There is no silver bullet, find a framework that fits your ideology, grow alongside it.
