History and Future of VR

Part I: Early VR Demos - let's put you on a rollercoaster!
* Nauseating games and advertising demos

Bad Thing #2: Want to move around
* Giant hamster wheels, omni-directional treadmills, the Omni pad

Fixes: Allow limited movement, or use __teleportation__
* HTC Vive - expensive but worth it!
* Types of games:
  * Training Wheels (Tilt Brush)
  * Task-Based (Job Simulator, Leaf Blower)
  * RTS (Cosmic Trip)
  * FPS Hybrid (Hover Junkers)
  * Old School (Wave Blaster)
  * Experiences (Reggie Watts VR Shows)

What's Next? What about AR?
* Relies on Bandwidth
* Image recognition (not great in real time)
* Objects (will be build through games in VR)

Steve Mann, MIT, wearable computing experiments in 1980's
* Computers conform to people, not other way around
* Persistent Palientology (surface data at relevant time)
* Social Punctuation (using tech in social, ruining experiences)
* Cool projects:
  * Body swap illusion
  * Diminished reality (hide ads, show texts instead)
  * Collaborative reality (cancel out disliked brands at a store)
  * Contextual notifications (looking at a grocery store? see a grocery list!)

Technology should consider social norms
* Camera phones are now Normal and Invisible
* Glasses are Restorative and Accepted
* Google Glass is Enhancing and Fear Inducing

Camera phone was just a progression of telephones, built on previous tech, accepted pretty quickly

Google glass was NOT a progression, just a massive leap in a closed system, scary

iPhone launch, another improvement on an existing system, developer onboarding, limited features, accepted
* Whoopie cushion apps, silly but show the system is open can can be fun

Building VR Experiences
* Unity, Steam VR Unity Toolkit
  * Tree climbing simulator! Made quickly with crappy assets, still a compelling experience
* Mozilla AFrame Web VR

Who to follow:
* VR Church Portland
* Stephanie Mendoza
* Reggie Watts
* Justin Roiland
* Owlchemy Labs
