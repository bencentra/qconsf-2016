## Intro

So many devices! Is this good? Smartwatches, Smart fridges, "dystopian kitchen of the future"

Connected pets - feeding devices went offline, didn't know if pets would starve or not, "new Schrodinger's Cat"

We live in an era of _interruptive_ technology
* Notifications bother you - interrupting attention
* Connection can be flaky or fail - interrupting bandwidth

## Calm Technology Origins

Mark Weiser + John Seeley Brown, Xerox Parc (mid-90's), "The Coming Age of Calm Technology"

In the past, we had many people per computer (mainframe). In the future, we'll have way more devices than people.

Not everything is a desktop computer. Why do we keep building systems that require as much attention as one?

Good tools are invisible - the tool doesn't intrude on your consciousness, focus on the task not the tool (e.g. a book)

## Designing Calm Technology

1) Technology should only call for your attention when needed (e.g. tea kettle)

2) Technology should empower the periphery (e.g. posture sensor, buzzes you when you exhibit poor posture)

Bad Example: beeping insulin pump, good for nurses, bad for personal use (why not buzz?)

3) Technology should inform and encalm (e.g. Hue lights connected to weather report)

4) Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity
* Machines shouldn't act like humans
* Humans shouldn't act like machines
* Example: automated phone trees, can't understand complexity, just talk/text a real person
* Example: Google search. Humans know context, machines can index and present data, humans make final choice of link

5) Technology can communicate, but it doesn't need to speak
* Example: Roomba - announces when complete or if stuck, otherwise runs on its own.

6) Technology should consider social norms
* Advanced technology gets rejected because we aren't "ready" for it

| Technology | Example | Social Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enhancing | Google Glass | Fear-Inducing |
| Normal | Camera Phone | Invisible |
| Restorative | Glasses | Accepted |

Google Glass was a huge leap in capability and was unapproachable. iPhone was a more gradual change and was quickly adopted. Fart apps proved the technology was fun, playful, not scary!

7) The right amount of technology is the minimum amount to solve the problem
* Street lights, toilet occupied sign
* We keep getting more powerful phones, but use more bloated software, end up with the same experience!
* Evolution of computers over time: far (mainframes), near (PCs), far (cloud), near (personal servers?)

The scarce resource of the 21st century will be _attention_.

## Q&A

How do we allow these devices to be in our environment, trust they won't beep at you?
* You can call out to Alexa
* People will adjust to the "language" of the device ("Alexa, Volume Level 7")
