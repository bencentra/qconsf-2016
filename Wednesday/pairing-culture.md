@nerdneha - Neha Batra (Pivotal)

Goals:
1) Failed Attempts
2) Pairing at Pivotal Labs
3) Pair Programming and You
4) Good Times
5) War Stories
6) Lessons Learned

Why care about pairing and culture?
* Inclusion
* Teamwork
* Learning
* Challenging ourselves

Pivotal practices XP (extreme programming), pairing whenever you're not in meetings

Drawbacks at solo programming:
* Distractions
* Cowboy-ism (taking over, great when correct, horrible if wrong)
* Unsustainable (overworking)
* Miscommunication
* Getting stuck

Enter pair programming!
* Less distractions. If you're talking to another person, less likely to pull out phone, it's rude!
* Enforce regular hours, more sustainable
* Can get help if stuck, can talk out of bad "cowboy" decisions

Failed Attempts:
* Not pairing very often
* Still have to get your own work done
* No way to capture contributions or credit the pair
* Pair didn't want to pair with you (not personal)
* It's "faster" by yourself
* Silent treatment (two people at one desk, not communicating)

Pair programming is HARD

Pivotal's Cultural Tenets:
* Do what works
* Do the right thing
* Be kind

Setup: 3 client engineers, 3 Pivotal engineers, pairs of one each, rotate pairs every day, keep stories with one half of pair to avoid context switching and constant onboarding.

Most stories don't take more than 2-3 days, fit within the constraints of pair rotating

Pivots are well-equipped and willing to:
* Be vulnerable
* Be fearless
* Go slower in the short term for long term gain
* Trust that others will do the right thing
* Eliminate code and emotional silos
* Do the right thing for the team

How do you build that kind of culture?
* TDD
* Set schedule
* Retros and feedback loops
* Well-written stories
* Fewer meetings
* Hiring for good pairs
* CI & CD
* Taking your mission seriously!

_How do you maintain well-written stories with less meeting?_

TDD & Pairing: it's easier to agree on a test than implementation, avoid fights.

First implementation should be the simplest, "red, green, refactor" (failing tests, passing tests, can we improve the code?)

No pull requests/judgement day!

Weekly schedule = Weekly iterations & feedback

Alignment, planning, execution, feedback, repeat.

Retros circulate feedback, always get new action items, bring up past week's retro items

Daily Retros are faster, useful for early in a project
* "How do you think it went?"
* "I was concerned about ________, did you feel that way?"
* "Should we try something new this time?"

"People are happiest when they are being productive"

All team members are colocated, just walk over and talk!

Best pairing conditions:
* Isolated team
* Few interruptions/meetings
* Buy-in to execute on priorities
* PM/Design resources available

How do you get buy-in? Convince someone to try it for "only" one week!

Pairing setup:
* 1 computer, 2 monitors, 2 mice, 2 keyboards
* Mirror screens
* Increase your font
* Git duet-commit
* Good IDE
* Keycastr to see shortcut keystrokes

Remote pairing:
* Good headphones
* Good internet connection
* Set schedule, procedures, and expectation
* More explicit back & forth
* Check-in more
* Take time to build rapport
* Try for some in-person pairing at first, if possible

Intangibles:
* Take turns
* Take breaks (bonding, time apart, emails)
* Ex__pair__iment - mobbing
* Keep an open mind

Pairing is like making a new friend, will be awkward at first. Accept it and give it time.

For the more experienced pair, you get:
* Fewer repeated questions
* Won't be called up on vacation

For the less experienced pair, you get:
* Learn more/faster
* Get reasoning behind methods & business choices

Good pairing looks like:
* Productivity
* Code quality
* Project success
* Happiness
* Skill growth/sharing
* Career success

Mitigating issues:
* SWOT analysis
* Personal Goals: what do we each want out of the project?
* Inception
* Set schedule/cadence
* Provide feedback opportunities at multiple level (pair, team, project)
* Provide a "safe haven" to get work done free from scope changes
* Have a way to collect concerns and dedicate time to discuss them

Lessons learned:
* Pair Programming is like making friends, it takes time
* You will need an extra hour or more of sleep per night, talking is exhausting
* Have patience with yourself and others
* You can code/ramp up with anything now

Cultural transformations: a few __good__ apples can __transform__ the whole barrel
