Ever notice it's easier to make decisions in startups?
* Closer connection to the people
* Might be easy but might not be the best decision
* "Strength lies in differences, not in similarities" - Stephen Covey

Diversity Breeds Innovation
* Forbes, University of Michigan, McKinsey
* Diversity can be as good or better as "smarts"

Progressive Insurance has inclusive teams, improved shareholder _and_ customer satisfaction.
* Compare to Allstate, that did the same by buying more companies, not becoming diverse itself

Best decisions come from "Disagreement and Contest, not Consensus or Compromise"
* How do you square __inclusiveness__ with __disagreement and contest__? Won't people feel shut out?

Consensus __Kills Culture__
* Consensus is the kryptonite of being bold
* Consensus gives power to Debbie Downer
  * Everyone has a veto power in consensus culture, don't want to give anyone veto power, will water down ideas
* Consensus typically leaves everyone unsatisfied

The Effects of Consensus Culture
* "We Move So Slowly"
* "We Never Take a Risk"
* "We Can't Make a Decision"

At a small company, everyone is on the same wavelength. This won't scale as the company does.

Consensus Avoids __Critical Conversations__
* Don't avoid creative tension, one excellent idea winning the day

What about a stalemate?
* Not consensus, but a decision cannot be reached
* You need a "North Star Vision" - A vision of your company's product or service that enables your employees to see your "noble purpose" - how you serve your customers today or want to tomorrow.
* Creating a Vision can be daunting

The Challenge: Abundance of choice -> decisions are muddled -> simplify expectations and find meaning

Liquid Expectations:
* "Why can't checking in/out of my hotel be as easy as using Uber?"
* "Why can't my cell phone bill be as easy to read as Mint.com?"
* "Why can't everything be as easy to find as it is on Google?"
* Other company's successes increasing expectations for TOTALLY UNRELATED businesses
* Finance example: Direct competitors (other banks), Experiential competitors (payment services, Venmo), Perceptual competitors (other services, Amazon)

More data doesn't necessarily mean more insight

Create the right frame to think about the work
* Make it customer focused
* Make it a real goal

How do you build a customer-focused vision statement?
* Talk with your customers (active listening, anthropology)
* Talk with your co-workers (those with empathy for customers - designers, sales, customer service)
* You have a good vision when team members use it to make decisions

How do you recognize destructive behaviors?
* Our brains are wired for fight or flight. Both are destructive.
  * Fight: pointing, standing, hovering, patterns of language, mouth dries out, voice raises
  * Flight: need to remove yourself from situation, quiet up with no opinion given, SPOOMA-like behavior ("sunshine pouring out of my ass", agreeing to end conversation)
* In a conversation, ask yourself:
  * What do I want for myself?
  * What do I want for others?
  * What do I really want for our product or service? <== North Star Vision
