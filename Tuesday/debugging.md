_Why do some people seem better at debugging? Why is debugging so hard?_

Debugging is hard because it's confusing!

## Act 1 - Why is debugging so hard?

Range of experience:
* Debugging is a skill, can get better at it over time

Some code has a confusing interface, hard to memorize, leads to bugs

Debugging has benefits - learning from mistakes - but has a bad stigma.

"Everyone knows debugging is twice as hard as programming..." challenge accepted!

Difficulty vs Skill:
* Too easy, highly skilled, debugging is __boring__ and __tedious__
* Too hard, not very skilled, debugging is __frustrating__ and __difficult__
* Middle area has a good "flow"

To gain skill, practice at the edge of your ability.

For debugging, this means learning something new!

No universities are teaching debugging in dedicated courses.

Bugs occur due to "chains of cognitive breakdowns" over the course of programming.

Even in a "Hello World", errors can arise anywhere between the software, tools, hardware, physics...

Debugging is hard in a "fixed mindset", can't/won't learn new skills

Debugging becomes easier in a "growth mindset", able/willing to pick up new skills and solve problems

## Act 2 - Mentoring growth

Creating growth-oriented teams start at hiring.

Promote growth by praising hard work, not smarts.

Debugging is not more "art" than "science," it's a privilege of experience. We forget what it's like to learn a thing.

We often debug symptoms, not causes. Avoid this by testing against a hypothesis.

Active Recall - trying to remember things you don't know instead of looking it up. Try it out, maybe fail, and learn something!

Spaced Practice - we need time to process new info. Don't stare at a problem for too long, take a break!

Persevere. Ask for help, then be available for others who need help.

Call to Action:
* Praise for effort
* Be Curious
* Science!
* Learn
* Empathize
* Teach/Mentor
* Persevere
