## Intro

Have you ever had a customer discard a product immediately?

A prototype makes an idea __tangible__. It is something you can __experience, test, and validate__.

Time and money are not infinite, so enter Rapid Prototyping! Learn fast + cheaply.

Not looking to impress your users, just want to learn from them.

## When do you prototype?

Multiple times throughout the process.

Fail fast and frequently early on - important learnings, lower cost, more willing to change.

Customer and engineer involvement in prototypes - thing is actually useful, possible to implement

## Example - Smart Shelf

Goal: Help customers make quicker and more informed purchase decisions by providing relevant product info while shopping

Started with paper prototypes, next to PowerPoint, then mid-fi prototype in Objective-C in 3 weeks.

Learnings:
* User didn't immediately know to pick stuff up
* Users weren't comfortable with everyone seeing their shopping choices
* Most users picked items at hip-height, not high or low shelves

More prototypes, update form factor (bit shelf + TV -> small kiosk w/ Tablet), test it again

Learnings:
* Start with one shoe on the pedestal, otherwise people will try placing multiple shoes

Advantages to prototyping:
* Data helps drive decisions
* Help get stakeholder buy-in on ideas

Prototypers are:
* "Fail forward fast"
* Scrappy
* Curious
* Risk-taker
* Bias towards action
* Hands-on
* Empathetic (towards user)
* Scientific

## Stages of Prototypes

Partial, Low-Fi - Imagine

Partial, Hi-Fi - Sell

Complete, Low-Fi - Test

Complete, Hi-Fi - Validate

No timeline, not a linear process!

## Methods

Paper prototypes:
* TEST
* Don't need to be beautiful, just convey an idea and make it tangible
* Slow down, step away from digital distractions
* Physically writing is better for memory than straight to computer
* Benefits: No software, Cheap, Easy to mock up, Flexible, disposable, Low learning curve
* Drawbacks: Not always understood, Doesn't scale, No animations/interactions, Ideas may get misinterpreted

Bodystorming:
* IMAGINE
* Use your body and props to demonstrate an idea
* Benefits: Free, everyone can participate, think creatively, engaging, visualize
* Drawbacks: Might get funny looks, not as effective if not coupled with no physical prototype, hard to guage feasability

Wireframes:
* SELL
* You know what these are!

## Tools

TEST and VALIDATE

Low-fi:
* Pop - Take picutes of paper prototype, add basic interactions, very fast!
* Balsamiq - "Ugly" on purpose (less investment), complete wireframes
* Moqups - Similar to Balsamiq, wireframes

Hi-fi:
* invision - remote presentation tools, collaboration and comments
* axure, proto.io - prototypes for desktop and mobile, complete interactions and animations

Many, many more - Xcode, Sketch, etc

Wireframing:
* Benefits: low cost, web based, many libraries of common patterns, responsive/mobile, feels real in user testing
* Drawbacks: medium learning curve, pattern sets can constrain productivity, limited flexibility with interactions

Coding:
* Benefits: platform independent, free, portable, helps gauge feasibility
* Drawbacks: Costs more, challenging to document effectively, can get sidetracked with implementation details

## Do's and Don'ts

Do:
* Get concepts on paper first
* Know your purpose - Sell, Imagine, Test, Validate
* Pick right level of fidelity
* Get it in front of users
* Manage stakeholder expectations
* Only prototype what is necessary

Picasso's Animal Studies: reduce animal to simplest form, minimum details to represent

Don't:
* Make code reusable
* Add too much fidelity
* Timebox
* Ignore feedback and patterns
* Prototype something that is infeasible
* Bias the user with your own opinion

User Testing:
* Know what you're trying to learn
* Show, don't tell
* Tell user to think out loud
* Ask follow-up questions (what do you think, what do you like/hate, why did you try that, etc)
* Don't bias the user

Compliments = BAD DATA

Use A/B testing when you need to compare 2 ideas. Can do it throughout the process.
