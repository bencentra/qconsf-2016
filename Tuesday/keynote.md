Big Data Meets the Cloud
* Addressing scaling patterns outside of the datacenter, using "public" cloud options

Evolving DevOps
* Incident Management, Monitoring Tools, Uptime Excellence, and more.

Software Engineering Softskills
* Softskills are often the "hardskills"
* Managing burnout, making better decisions, social coding, rapid prototyping

Modern CD in the Real World
* We don't always understand our tools, want to show how modern CS research will make tools less "magic"
* Unikernels (stripping down your software), testing techniques, concurrency

## Keynote - Michael Lopp

Attributes of growth shared by Netscape, Apple, Palantir, Pinterest, Slack, and more

Bores easily, new job every ~3 years.

Afraid of irrelevance. Technology changes very rapidly, gotta stay fresh.
* Snapchat, Pokemon Go - not changing the world, but enable you to play!

Except for a startup, all companies had a successful "first act," formed a business and created a product

Welcome to WINNING!

Flying toaster screensaver - After Dark (screensaver software) made MILLIONS, software that's useful when you don't use it!

1, 2, 30, 300 - a story of growth

Bob is working alone in his garage. Needs to make a choice, does it quick because it's just him.

Bob hires Liz. Needs to make a choice, Bob and Liz might disagree, decision takes longer. Bob wins the argument.

What was different about Bob vs Bob and Liz? They had their FIRST MEETING!
* Not just you
* Working together to solve a problem
* In a finite amount of time
* As needed

Even in that first "meeting," Bob and Liz were building culture. Did Bob uses status? logic? shouting?

Slack uses a cute Raccoon to indicate "move the conversation to the correct room", channels are sacred

Bob now has 30 employees. Ideas are coming from everywhere, decisions are collaborative and visible, still gotta work fast, everyone knows and does everything, rapid and organic error correction, etc.

The Old Guard - Built the company, use past results for direction, have status, never write things down, created the company culture

Bob now has 300 employees. Ideas are showing up but there are TONS, decisions are happening slower, execution is being stove-piped, stories being retold as myth, situational awareness is becoming expensive, increasing communication friction, learning can't occur via osmosis

The New Guard - Here because of the Old Guard's mission, quickly outnumber them, write things down, imports culture from previous gigs, and they SCHEDULE MEETINGS

The Old Guard believes the lessons of past are diffinitive, would rather chat than write, feel the new process is heavy and will disagree with the New Guard

Incomplete dialogue, not properly articulating values. "Process feels heavy" means "we value velocity over completeness", Old Guard isn't communicating it well.

Old Guard hires New Guard to solve problems, but don't like how they're doing it. Things BLOW UP, politics get in the way.

One big team becomes three smaller teams, separate planning, directors, etc, affects efficiency and morale.

This divide can kill first act companies. Meetings create power structures, cause divisions.

It's not about __meetings__, it's about __values__.

Second Act companies - HP, IBM, Microsoft - big, valuable, long living, many products, successful culture

Second Act is winning. What does winning REALLY look like? Why is the second product so hard?

Fear of change. Old Guard? New Guard? Everyone!

A confusing omnipresent fore that doesn't believe the new and compelling can exist.

Groupthink, going with the crowd, avoid unique perspectives. Diverse teams help prevent this, more opinion, better at disagreeing.

Fundamental parts of the culture must evolve to encourage the Second Act

Apple had 2 teams creating the OS for first iPhone - OSX team and iOS team. iOS team won, threw out all the other work. Kept teams completely separate.

Apple had a "dictator," a healthy one in Steve Jobs, could make the tough decisions.

Apple had an "Engineering Program Manager" role for communicating across teams, tie it all together, empowered to drive things forward.

The Culture Must Evolve
* First act lessons might not take you to second act
* Process is documented culture, must be able to defend itself

Apple killed the iPod Mini, moved on to the Nano, kill the product before the competition can catch up

Slack is all about changing communication habits

Be unfailingly kind
