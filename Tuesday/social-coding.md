@haacked - Phil Haack (GitHub)

GitHub was originally ~50 people, no real managers, no real way to enforce standards and give feedback.

You want to encourage growth through feedback, not punish someone.

## Feedback Formula

__Situation:__ Describe the context, be specific and timely

__Behavior:__ Describe the behavior clearly, try not to draw conclusions

__Impact:__ Describe the results of the behavior (positive or negative)

__Next Steps:__ Identify what specific behavior should be changed or repeated

Incorrect behavior should be addressed and corrected

Correct behavior should _also_ be addressed and rewarded

_"What is the cost of a compliment?"_

## Trust

As your company grows, you will need managers.

Manager Tools Podcast:
* "Building a relationship and trust with your people is the fundamental act of managing."
* "The most powerful thing we've ever recommended to any manager in the world is to sit down and talk to their folks on a weekly basis, regularly, like clockwork"

Good template:
* 10 minutes for engineer
* 10 minutes for manager

_"People almost never change without first feeling understood."_ - Difficult Conversations

The three conversations:

__What Happened?__ Disagreement about what happened or what should have happened

__Feelings:__ Every difficult conversation asks and answers questions about feelings

__Identity:__ The conversation with ourselves. Are we competent, incompetent, good, bad? How will this impact our self-image?

## Diversity and Inclusion

The social justice argument for diversity is "table stakes" compared to the benefits to decision making.

Programming was "women's work," hardware was for men. "Managers hired women because they expected programming to be a low-skill clerical function, akin to filing, typing, or telephone switching." This was incorrect.

"Prestige" Formula:
* Create professional Associations
* Erect educational requirements
* Discourage hiring women

Be aware of uncounscious bias:
* 58% of CEOs are 6ft tall or greater
* White-sounding names on resumes receive 50% more callbacks for interviews
* Both female and male faculty hiring student lab assistants were biased against female applicants

Why should I care about diversity?
* Diversity is a competitive advantage
  * Companies with more female board directors performed 50% better
  * McKinsey analysis: companies outperform bottom 25% by 15% if gender diverse, 35% if ethnically diverse
  * In US, for every 10% increase in diversity among execs creates 0.8% earnings increase
* Complex decision making improves
  * Interacting with individuals who are different forces group members to prepare better, anticipate alternate viewpoints, and expect reaching consensus will take effort.

Mitigating bias:
* Women often wait until they meet 100% of requirements to apply for a job; men about 60%.
* Avoid language like "ninja" or "rockstar", can turn female candidates away
* "Would grab a beer with" style interviews are very vulnerable to bias
* Favor real-world situational questions vs abstract problem solving
